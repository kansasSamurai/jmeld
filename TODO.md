# Discussion
## Run Jmeld in Swing form - Feature Request
https://sourceforge.net/p/jmeld/discussion/547688/thread/594b540b/?limit=25#0cd3
(This is pretty much a rehash of Feature Request #13)

I would like a redirection to class name/interface so I can use JMeld visual diff panel in swing app without the JMeld external UI (tabs menus etc)

For example :
JPanel panel = new JPanel panel = new JPanel(new FlowLayout());
// probably not so easy...
JMeldDiffPanel jmeldDiff = JMeldDiffPanel(New File(a.txt), New File(a.txt));
panel.add(jmeldDiff);

This should work:

panel = new JMeldPanel();
panel.SHOW_TOOLBAR_OPTION.disable();
panel.SHOW_TABBEDPANE_OPTION.disable();
panel.openComparison(args[0], args[1]);
